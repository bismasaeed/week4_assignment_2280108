This Flutter project is a simple weather app that fetches and displays the current weather for Karachi using the OpenWeatherMap API. It features real-time weather data fetching, displays temperature, weather conditions, city name, high and low temperatures, and shows the current date and time. The app utilizes FutureBuilder to handle asynchronous API requests. Key technologies used include Flutter for UI development, the HTTP package for API requests, the Intl package for date and time formatting, and the OpenWeatherMap API for weather data.
